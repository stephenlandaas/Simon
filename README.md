# Simon
A quick, short, and fun console game made using C++ that's an imitation of the popular game Simon.

This game was written using C++ and Visual Studio, and it will work properly on a Windows environment and should be compiled on Visual Studio 2015 or newer versions of VS. Consisting of just under 200 lines of code, this is a console-based game written in C++ that's an imitation of the popular memory game Simon. 

Colors will flash and it is up to the user to try to repeat such a pattern, and as each round progresses the pattern will become longer and harder to memorize. No graphical libraries were used, and the console color and beeping sounds are provided courtesy of the "Windows.h" libary. This game should run on any size console screen, however 120 x 30 is recommended if you wish to keep some of the text centered properly.

A .bin file is provided (HIGH-SCORE.bin) that stores the user's highest score ever achieved, and will save the data even after the program is closed. This was implemented to encourage the user to continuously try to beat their previous high-score. By default, a score of 0 is currently saved to the file.
